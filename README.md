## Project Overview

In this project, we explore customer churn analysis and prediction for a telecommunications company. Our primary goal is to understand customer attrition patterns and identify strategies for improving customer retention. We achieve this through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling.

## Design Thinking Process

### Analysis Objectives

1. **Identify Potential Churners:** Our aim is to create a system capable of foreseeing which customers are likely to leave our service soon.

2. **Unearth Key Factors:** We intend to uncover the core factors responsible for customer churn. This means delving into the reasons why customers choose to discontinue their use of our services.

### Data Collection

We collect diverse data types to gain a holistic understanding of our customer base. Data categories include:
- Customer Demographics
- Usage Behavior Tracking
- Historical Interactions Archive

### Visualization Strategy

We employ a multi-faceted visualization strategy to convey insights effectively:
1. **Illustrating Churn Factors:** We create visually appealing representations, such as charts and graphs, to elucidate which factors wield the most significant influence on customer churn.
2. **Shining a Spotlight on Retention Rates:** Through visualizations, we showcase the company's effectiveness in retaining customers over time, offering insights into retention rate trends and comparisons.

### Predictive Modeling

Our predictive modeling process comprises:
1. **Selecting Machine Learning Algorithms:** We carefully choose the most suitable machine learning techniques to construct predictive models.
2. **Feature Selection:** We make informed decisions regarding which customer attributes should serve as inputs for the predictive model.

## How to Replicate the Analysis

### Requirements

To replicate this analysis, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
- Python (version 3.X)
- Jupyter Notebook
- IBM Cognos (if applicable)

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Data Collection**: Gather the customer data as described in the project documentation.

2. **Data Visualization using IBM Cognos**: If you are using IBM Cognos for data visualization, follow these steps to create visualizations:

   Step 1: Log In: Go to the IBM Cognos website and log in with your username and password.

   Step 2: Connect Data: Choose your data source, like a database or spreadsheet, to access your data.

   Step 3: Create Content: Make a report, dashboard, or chart, depending on what you need.

   Step 4: Pick Data: Select the data you want to visualize from your source.

   Step 5: Design Visuals: Create charts, tables, and graphs to show your data.

   Step 6: Style Visuals: Customize the look of your visuals with colors, fonts, and labels.

   Step 7: Add Interactivity: Make your reports interactive with filters and prompts.

   Step 8: Organize: Arrange your visuals neatly on your report or dashboard.

   Step 9: Save and Share: Save your work and share it with others, like PDFs or Excel files.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python**: Run the Python code for in-depth analysis of the data:
   - [`DAC_phase3.ipynb`](DAC_phase3.ipynb)

4. **Feature Engineering**: Apply feature encoding and scaling using the provided Python code:
   - [`DAC_phase4.ipynb`](DAC_phase4.ipynb)

5. **Model Selection and Evaluation using Python**: Implement and evaluate the predictive models with the provided code:
   - [`phase5_model_selection.ipynb`](DAC_Model.ipynb)

6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Document the insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## Example Outputs
